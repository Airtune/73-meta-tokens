# Mint Blocks

Several different types of blocks can a mint block with different behaviour.

A mint block must immediately follow the `#supply` block.


## `change#mint`

A change block with the `representative` field set to an `metadata_representative`.

This block will mint an asset in the issuer account.

This block's hash will be used for the `asset_representative`.


## `send#mint`

A send block with the `representative` field set to an `metadata_representative`.

This block will mint an asset and send it.

This block's hash will be used for the `asset_representative`.

### `send#mint` validation

The `send#mint` block must be received by a `receive#mint` or `receive#asset` block, which is just a regular receive on Banano, before any other action is allowed such as `send#asset` or `send#atomic_swap`.

Self-`send#mint` blocks are allowed, e.g., link matches sender/minter account. Self-`send#mint` blocks must be received before any other action is allowed such as `send#asset` or `send#atomic_swap`.

## `metadata_representative` validation

* Must not match the `supply_representative` header.

* Must not match the `finish_supply_representative` header.

* Must not match the `atomic_swap_representative` header.
